# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the `pygame` library.

## How to Play

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python and `pygame` installed.
    *   You can install `pygame` using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install pygame
        ```

2.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```

3.  **Controls:**
    *   Use the **arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the snake.
    *   The goal is to eat the green food blocks to grow your snake.
    *   Avoid running into the walls or into the snake's own body.

4.  **Game Over:**
    *   If you collide with a wall or the snake's body, the game is over.
    *   You will be prompted to either play again by pressing 'C' or quit by pressing 'Q'.
